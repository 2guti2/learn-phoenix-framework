# "Advanced" Phoenix ("Hot") Deployment
## _using_ Distillery and Edeliver

## Why?

Erlang gives us "***Hot-code Upgrades***" which mean we can do
"***Zero Downtime Deployment***". <br />
This means **people** can **_continue using_** the **app**
`while` the app is **being updated/upgraded**!
Most other languages/frameworks/platforms make you work _really_ hard
to get this feature, so _not_ using it seems kinda wasteful!

###Â Why Not Use Heroku?

Heroku is a _superb_ way to deploy your Phoenix App(s)
while in "Beta" because it has great _automatic
deployment_ (hooks) from GitHub, good logging etc.

If your Product Owner / Client Stake Holders `require`
you to deploy to a different environment,
then you need to get "_advanced_".

> If you are just starting out deploying Phoenix,
we _strongly **recommend**_ sticking with Heroku. <br />
(_debugging DevOps deployments isn't a "fun" activity,
so save it for later!_ ;-) <br />
Please see:
[github.com/dwyl/**learn-heroku**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-heroku)
(_beginner's guide to deploying on Heroku_) <br />
and Phoenix _specific_ [/**heroku-deployment**.md](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-phoenix-framework/blob/master/heroku-deployment.md)

## What?

The two (_main_) tools we will be using are:

+ **Distillery**: https://github.com/bitwalker/distillery - builds the release
binary including BEAM so there is _nothing_ to install on the VM!
+ **edeliver**: https://github.com/boldpoker/edeliver - deploys the release
to VM(s) using SSH.

# How?

We have broken down this ***step-by-step guide*** into **two sections**:

1. **Single Server** Setup - when you only want to **pay** for a single server
  but want to get a lot more for your money than on Heroku.
2. "***High Availability Cluster***" setup that can (easily) handle
[_**Millions of Concurrent Connections**_](http://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/the-road-to-2-million-websocket-connections)
with **_Zero_ Downtime** Delpoys/Updates!

# Single Server Setup

For the purposes of this walkthrough I will be using Microsoft Azure
Linux Virtual Machines, but this setup has been tested on:
+ Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2)
+ Digital Ocean

> If you are new to Azure or prefer to use a different hosting/"Cloud" service,
please let us know: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-phoenix-framework/issues

## Deploy a "_Hello World_" Phoenix App using Edeliver

Our objective is to _**keep things** as **simple** as **possible**_,
so we are _not_ going to deploy an _existing_ app;
Instead we are deploying a "**Hello World**" **app** in order to
test _just_ the deployment process ("_pipeline_") in _isolation_
(_minimising the variables to avoid contending with any "application issues"_).


> _**Credit**: the instructions in this "**Hello World**"
deployment are adapted from the **superb** post by @pcorey:_ <br />
http://www.east5th.co/blog/2017/01/16/simplifying-elixir-releases-with-edeliver
<br />
> _We have merely **simplified**
(or in some cases **expanded/clarified**) the steps.
But **all** credit goes to Pete for distilling the instructions
in the first place!_ ;-)






## Cluster Setup Server

Thankfully, if you followed the "Single Server Setup" (_above_),
a lot of this will be _familiar_ to you.






+ SSH to server as root e.g: `ssh root@178.62.57.75`
(_replace for your IP Address_)
+ `sudo apt-get install git`
  + `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
  + `git config --global user.email "your@email.co.uk"`
+ `wget https://packages.erlang-solutions.com/erlang-solutions_1.0_all.deb && sudo dpkg -i erlang-solutions_1.0_all.deb`
+ `sudo apt-get update`
+ `sudo apt-get install elixir`
+ `mix local.hex`
+ `mix archive.install https://github.com/phoenixframework/archives/raw/master/phoenix_new.ez`
+ `sudo apt-get install erlang-base-hipe`
+ `sudo apt-get install build-essential`
+ `sudo apt-get install erlang-dev`
+ `chmod -R 777 /opt`
+ `mkdir /git`
+ `chmod -R 777 /git`

+ On the _remote_ server,
Create the file `/home/builder/prod.secret.exs` with this command:
`mkdir -p /home/builder/ && vi /home/builder/prod.secret.exs`


### Setup EDeliver Project

+ add edeliver dependency in your `mix.exs` file (pointing to master branch on GH for now...):
`{:edeliver, git: "https://github.com/boldpoker/edeliver.git"}`
+ change `{:phoenix_live_reload, "~> 1.0", only: :dev}` to `{:phoenix_live_reload, "~> 1.0"}`
+ add `, :edeliver, :phoenix_live_reload` to applications list
+ `mix deps.get`
+ `mix deps.compile`
+ `mkdir .deliver && touch .deliver/config` to create the `.deliver` directory and config file.
+ populate config file with the following:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

APP="my_awesome_app" # name of your release

BUILD_HOST="server ip / hostname" # host where to build the release
BUILD_USER="root" # local user at build host
BUILD_AT="/git/my_awesome_app/builds" # build directory on build host
RELEASE_DIR="/git/my_awesome_app/builds/rel/my_awesome_app"
RELEASE_VERSION=0.0.1

STAGING_HOSTS="server ip / hostname" # staging / test hosts separated by space
STAGING_USER="git" # local user at staging hosts
TEST_AT="/test/my_awesome_app" # deploy directory on staging hosts. default is DELIVER_TO

PRODUCTION_HOSTS="server ip / hostname" # deploy / production hosts separated by space
PRODUCTION_USER="root" # local user at deploy hosts
DELIVER_TO="/opt/my_awesome_app" # deploy directory on production hosts

# For *Phoenix* projects, symlink prod.secret.exs to our tmp source
pre_erlang_get_and_update_deps() {
  local _prod_secret_path="/home/builder/prod.secret.exs"
  if [ "$TARGET_MIX_ENV" = "prod" ]; then
    __sync_remote "
      ln -sfn '$_prod_secret_path' '$BUILD_AT/config/prod.secret.exs'
    "
  fi
}
```

Paste the contents of your _local_ `config/prod.secret.exs` into the remote one.

```
mix release.init
MIX_ENV=prod mix release --env=prod
```

mix edeliver build release --branch=master --verbose

Now attempting to follow this:
Elixir/Phoenix deployments using Distillery http://crypt.codemancers.com/posts/2016-10-06-elixir-phoenix-distillery



On the server run the following command:
```
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 4000
```
To _confirm_ the routing from port 80 to 4000 run the following command:
```
sudo iptables -t nat --line-numbers -L
```
That should _list_ the routing rules:

If you need to _undo_ this command run:
```
sudo iptables -t nat -F
```
