# _Note on Code Examples_

Many (_most?_) of the Examples in this `/examples` dir
are either derived/adapted from or directly "_borrowed_" <br />
from the _fantastic_ book:
**Programming Phoenix** by the _brilliant_ Chris McCord! @chrismccord
(_who **created** Phoenix_!)

> If you are learning Phoenix from scratch the @dwyl tutorial will
only get you through your **_first_ hour**.

If you decide to _embrace_ Phoenix
for your next personal or _client_
project we **_highly_ recommend** <br />
that you **_immidiately_ purchase** Chris's _excellent_ book!
It is the _single_ best place/way to learn Phoenix. <br />
The book is _really_ well written, by a _seasoned_ technical writer
and has superb editorial "_coherence_" <br />
from the great people of @pragprog.com

We have **_purchased_ several physical copies** of the Book for DWYL
these are being used by team members as reference guides.

If you are a _remote_ learner/team member and would like a _physical_
("hard") copy of the book <br />
and for _any_ reason _cannot afford to buy one_ please let us know
ane we will try to help out!<br />
please show your interest on
the issue on GitHub: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir/issues/11

We will _mail_ a ***free*** (_paid for by DWYL_) copy of the book
to _any_ address in the world! Just get in touch (_on the issue_)!

Yes, we _know_ that Google has a _list_ of where you can download
the eBook _without_ paying for it:
https://www.google.com/search?q=Programming%20Phoenix%201.3%20pdf

But we _strongly urge_ anyone who wants to _use_ Phoenix in any
(_professional_) capacity to ***pay*** for the
(_~~hundreds~~ thousands of hours_) hard work Chris, Bruce and Jos√©
and the "Prag Prog" team have put
into _crafting_ this superb learning resource!!

If you do _any_ work in Phoenix the price of the book will be paid for
in the first couple of hours of work!
If you _want_ to do any ***paid*** work in Phoenix
just look at the DWYL backlog and you can get paid
for your knowledge/skills/contributions ***immediately***!

_Happy Phoneix Leaning Everyone_! :droplet: :heart: :white_check_mark: :rocket:
